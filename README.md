The repository I downloaded is from Politico. It's called Gootenberg and Politico describes it as "a tool for handling everything a news developer needs from the Google API." On its GitHub page, Politico says, "news developers are writing their own utilities to process data from Google Drive for special projects rigs, and we can make something better if we stop all that duplication." I know generally what the Google API is, but I don't know how news organizations use it for special projects, but I know it's important. 
I'm genuinely unsure what this repository is doing. My best guess is trying to consolidate Google Drive. There is a config folder, a dist folder, a docs and a src folder within the repository I cloned. 
	In the module.js file, there are a LOT of "import" commands, including "map values" and "URL." This file also contains "function" commands and "if" commands. There is also the word or command "blob," "const" and "get" in the code quite a few times.  
Some questions I still have are:
	What do all of the files within the repository I cloned mean? 
		If I could understand that, I think I could understand better what they're all doing.
	What are .md files?
	What are .js files?
	What do all the commands I described finding in the code mean and do?
